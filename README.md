# SchoolGrades_Average

Exercise:

Build an algorithm to read 3 grades of a class with 5 students. 
For each student, calculate the average like: avg = (g1 + g2 + g3)/3. 
Grades are between 0(lowest) and 20(maximum).
Besides that, calculate the class average. 
Show the students average with a message like "Aproved" case the average is greater than 10 or "Failed" if below 10.
